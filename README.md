# Food-Sales-Analysis
The portfolio describes a food sales data analysis focused on assessing pizza sales performance using a year's sales data from a food restaurant in 2015. The dataset encompasses critical details such as total revenue, order count, quantity sold, average order value, and more, categorized by various pizza types, sizes, and days of order.

Data transformation and analysis were performed on the sales data using Advanced SQL Queries to unveil daily and monthly sales trends, evaluate pizza performance across categories and sizes, and identify the best and worst-selling pizza options. This project provided valuable insights into areas of success and those requiring improvement. 

The key insights are described below: 

**Daily Sales Trends**
- Sales peaks were observed on Fridays and Saturdays, indicating heightened weekend demand.
- Mondays recorded the lowest number of orders, potentially indicating lower weekday demand.

**Monthly Sales Trends**
- A seasonal pattern emerged with the period from March to July showing the highest order volumes, signifying seasonality in sales.
- January registered the lowest order volumes, potentially due to post-holiday season behavior.

**Pizza Category Analysis**
- Classic pizza emerged as the top-selling category, accounting for 26.88% of total sales.
- Veggie pizza had the lowest sales performance among categories.

**Pizza Size Analysis**
- Large pizzas proved to be the most popular, contributing 45.87% of total sales, highlighting customer preference for larger pizza sizes.
- Very large pizzas represented only 0.13% of total sales.

**Best and Worst Sellers**
- The Thai Chicken Pizza generated the highest revenue.
- The Classic Deluxe pizza was the best-selling pizza in terms of quantity sold and contributed substantially to overall revenue.
- The Brie Carre pizza consistently performed poorly across revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.

Key findings indicated that sales tend to peak on weekends, particularly during the summer months. Large classic pizzas were the customers's favorite, while the Brie Carre pizza consistently underperformed through the sales period.

To further enhance sales based on this analysis, it is recommended that weekend promotional offers should be explored, introducing seasonal summer specialty pizzas, and evaluating strategies to enhance the performance of weaker-performing pizzas, whether through recipe adjustments, marketing efforts, or pricing alterations. 

Alternatively, discontinuing unpopular pizza options may also be considered. This project highlights the practical application of data insights to drive initiatives aimed at tangibly improving restaurant performance.
