SALES ANALYSIS (PIZZA )
This portfolio highlights my food services data analytics work on a project assessing pizza sales performance using sales data from a pizza restaurant over the last year (2015). The data contains details on total revenue, orders, quantity sold, average order value, and more for different pizza types, sizes, and days of order. 
Data transformation and analysis for this project was done using SQL. The developed Key Performance Indicators and details of the analysis can be accessed in this GitHub link "https://github.com/example/pizza-sales-analysis". 
My analysis aimed to uncover daily and monthly trends in pizza sales, analyze performance by pizza category and size, and identify best and worst selling pizzas. I leveraged this robust data source to provide insights into successes and highlight areas needing improvement.
At the Daily Level
•	Sales peaked on Fridays and Saturdays indicating higher demand on weekends.
•	Mondays had the lowest number of orders.
At the Monthly Level
•	March to July saw the highest number of orders indicating seasonality in sales.
•	January had the lowest orders.
 By Pizza Category
•	Classic pizza was the best-selling category making up 26.88% of the total sales.
•	Veggie pizza sold the least.
By Pizza Size
•	Large pizzas accounted for 45.87% of sales indicating customer preference for large pizzas.
•	Very large pizzas only made up 0.13% of sales.
Best and Worst Sellers
•	The Thai Chicken Pizza generated the most revenue. 
•	The Classic Deluxe pizza sold the highest quantity contributing maximally to the accrued revenue.
•	The Brie Carre pizza was the worst performer in terms of revenue, quantity sold, and total orders.
Key findings from this analysis revealed sales peaked on weekends and in the summer months. Large classic pizzas were the most popular, while Brie Carre sold poorly. 
To further improve sales based on this analysis, I recommended introducing weekend promotional offers, consideration of seasonal summer specialty pizzas, and evaluating ways to improve poorer-performing pizzas through changes in recipe, marketing, or pricing. Alternatively, unpopular pizzas could be discontinued. This project exemplified using data to guide initiatives that tangibly improve restaurant performance.
